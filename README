Demo Description
  The demo is a simple client-server setup demonstrating a simplified version of TLS/SSL

  A client will send messages to the server and will then wait for an echo.
  The client initiates the connection to perform a simplified TLS handshake with the server in order to share a session key to encrypt the messages sent and then echoed back. The client and server will both run until stopped. The client sends messages every 10 seconds.

  The basics of the TLS handshake are:
    1. Client connects to server, shares certificate, asks server to identify itself
    2.    Server sends public key
    3. Client creates, encrypts (with server public key), and sends AES session key
    4.    Server decrypts session key, sends acknowledgement (encrypted with session key)
    .... All proceeding transmissions encrypted with session key

  Both the client and server show information regarding the handshake while running. This is the observable. The output should be labelled with the corresponding step of TLS above.


Running the Demo

  In the root folder, there is a setup script that will generate a set of RSA key files for both the Server and Client. Run this with:

    ./setup

  Run the following script to start the Server

    ./startServer

  Run the following to start the Client. This is intended to be done is another terminal window for demonstration purposes.

    ./startClient
